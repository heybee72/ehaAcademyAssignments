    <h1>Africa my Africa</h1>
    <p>Africa of proud warriors in ancestral Savannahs</p>
    <p>Africa of whom my grandmother sings</p>
    <p>On the banks of the distant river</p>
    <p>I have never known you</p>
    <p>But your blood flows in my veins</p>
    <p>Your beautiful black blood that irrigates the fields</p>
    <p>The blood of your sweat</p>
    <p>The sweat of your work</p>
    <p>The work of your slavery</p>
    <p>Africa, tell me Africa</p>
    <p>Is this your back that is unbent</p>
    <p>This back that never breaks under the weight of humiliation</p>
    <p>This back trembling with red scars</p>
    <p>And saying no to the whip under the midday sun?</p>
    <p>But a grave voice answers me</p>
    <p>Impetuous child that tree, young and strong</p>
    <p>That tree over there</p>
    <p>Splendidly alone amidst white and faded flowers</p>
    <p>That is your Africa springing up anew</p>
    <p>springing up patiently, obstinately</p>
    <p>Whose fruit bit by bit acquires</p>
    <p>The bitter taste of liberty.</p>
