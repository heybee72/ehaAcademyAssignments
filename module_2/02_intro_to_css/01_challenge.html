        <p>The <em>Koala</em> is awesome because <strong> they look cute even when they’re terrified.</strong>.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying that a koala has never enjoyed being petted. We can only guess what they enjoy and what they don’t. A koala orphan being raised by a wildlife caretaker may enjoy being petted by their caretaker. But being petted by a stranger? All the evidence suggests that koalas do not enjoy that, and it may even be harming them.</p>
